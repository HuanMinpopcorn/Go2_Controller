## quadrupedal common gait pattern 
Each leg of the robot has two phases: the "touch ground" phase, where the leg is in contact with the ground (called the **stance leg**), and the "flying" phase, where the leg is off the ground (called the **swing leg**). During quadrupedal walking, each legâ€™s end effector alternates between these two phases. The specific pattern of switching between these phases for all four legs is referred to as the **gait**.
